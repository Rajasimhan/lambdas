This project provides a basic idea on how lambdas in java 8 (& above) can be implemented as a method parameter.

Functional Interfaces (or Lambdas) can used as a concise anonymous methods. These are really useful when one needs to refactor a code that has lots of common logic and the custom parts can be passed as lambdas. 
Also Lambdas can be really useful while performing various operations on collections via streams.
